Step 3: Analyze market signals - BTC shows the strongest momentum with MACD rising from 4.40 to 27.17 over the last 10 periods and price consistently above EMA20. ETH is more range-bound but stable. Other assets show oversold conditions but lack clear directional signals. Step 4: Decision - Given the positive momentum in BTC and stable ETH position, holding current positions is justified. The defined exit plans provide risk management. Step 5: Justification - BTC's rising MACD and price action support continuation of the current trend. ETH's stability near EMA20 suggests the position remains valid. No new entries recommended given current negative total return and to maintain risk discipline.",

Analyzed market signals: ETH shows concerning technicals - trading below EMA20, negative MACD momentum, and overbought RSI at 77.24. BTC and ETH both show consistent negative MACD trends. 4. Decision: Close ETH position due to bearish technicals and overbought conditions. Hold BNB as it's profitable and near EMA20. Hold BTC despite small loss due to low 1x leverage. 5. Justification: Risk management dictates closing the ETH position with negative momentum and overbought RSI to prevent further losses.
